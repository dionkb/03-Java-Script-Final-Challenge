# 03-Java-Script-Final-Challenge
Final challenge for week 3 project covering JavaScript. This project was completed in order to utilize the techniques I have been learning in Javascript.

## Description

This webpage will allows a user to input specific characteristics for a password generator, which will take the inputs and give them a password that matches the criteria. For example, a user may need a password that is: 17 characters long, includes upper and lowercase letter, does not include numbers, and does include special characters. The generator will prompt the user to input that information, and then build a password that fits the request: aoF!%fadTh(&&kTG; Voila!
